`My name is Abhilash. I'm a Sofware engineer, mainly working on web applications. I've listed some of my projects in Projects section, do check it.`,

`I work on all parts of web application development. Parts i enjoy most are at the intersection of product/application and infrastructure, such as CI/CD and Monitoring. Though currently focused on frontend and backend product development, my goal is to slowly transition into teams that build tooling to improve this intersection.`,

`I contribute to opensource projects in spare time, mainly at observability communities, helping them with small-medium features, testing, documentation or anything i could do really in time i got. I enjoyed learning many things and not to mention giving back to community. I also got to interact with amazing engineers from different companies.`,

`Besides technical work, I listen to tons of radio. I also enjoy cooking and discovering new recipes. I travel now and then to explore new places or simply exploring on my bike if not far. When I can, i take part in voluntary work in my city.`,

`Kia Ora! I found Kia Ora in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVDu0tJHTnY">video</a>. Have a great day :)`,
